# Calculator optimum coagulant dose
Welcome! [IHE Delft](http://un-ihe.org)
## Introduction
Coagulation is a general treatment method to remove suspended fine particles, colour and other constituents from raw water, after adding chemicals (coagulants) and followed by further treatment. Coagulation is often applied in both conventional and advanced water treatment processes for the production of drinking water. 

Theoretical calculation of the optimum coagulant dose is not possible. Therefore, for each raw water experiments are needed. In glass beakers the coagulation process (rapid mixing, flocculation and sedimentation) is performed as shown in Fiure. This bench scale test is the so called “Jar test”. 

The overall aim of this project is to make an app which allows to analyze the google sheet data generated from the lab jar test experiments and calcualte the optimum coagulant dose. The app also allows the users to eneters the some plant operational data to calculate the total coagulant dose needed.

A live app can be found [here](https://coagulant-dose-calculator.herokuapp.com/).

# 1. About the coagulant calculator app
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

This app is designed to calcualte the optimum coagulant dose that need to be applied in a water treatment plant based on the raw water quality.The app determine the optimum dose based on the laboratory data from google sheet. The app also calcualte the total amount ot dose needed based on the type of coagulant used, optimum dose and user input (flow rate and storage time of the coagulant). The app can be used by the plant operator, students and water supply engineering professonals.

# 2. User Expereince (UX) design
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

  Dosing of coagulant (chemical) i.e. FeCl3 is needed to remove the fine particles from drinking water treatment. Moreover, overdosing of the chemicals will support for the resuspension of partcles and is also an environmental issues. Therefore, optimization of the coagulant dose based on the water qaulity is rather important which save cost and environment. This project is aimed to design the app which allows to calcualte the optimum coagulant dose based on the experimental data provided in google sheet and ultimately calcualte the total dose required depending upon the type of coagulant used. 

The following users types can be benifitted from the app:

- Drinking water treatment plant operators
- Professionals dealing with water treatment designs.
- Post graduate students in the field of water supply and environmental engineering.

## 2.1 User Goals
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

The main goal of this project is to develop a coagulant dose calcualtor app that allows to calcualte the optimum coagulant dose for diffent water types. This is of great useful for me to apply in my teaching for a demonstration in the laboratory session to my students.

## 4.2 Future Feature
In future i plan to update the app including more features such as;
 - Allow users to select option for choosing differnt types of coagulants like FeCl3, NaOCl, Al2SO4 etc
 - Provide users the basic dimension of the coagulation unit required for the given type of the water

  ![PEP8_online_validation](images/pep8_online.jpg)
## 6.2 Mannual testing 
### 6.2.1 Google sheet
TEST            | OUTCOME                          | PASS / FAIL  
--------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------
Google sheet | checked if the data provided in the google sheet is either float number or integer only except table heading. If that is not true then a message pop up "google sheet data is not valid ! Please check the data entry".| PASS

## 6.2.2 User input 
TEST            | OUTCOME                          | PASS / FAIL  
--------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------
User input | checked if the data provided by user is either integer or float or positive. In case not true then it gives an error message "Please enter numeric value greater than 0" and "Enter value can't be zero or negative, try again". This message po up until the correct input value is provided by user.| PASS

# 7. Bugs
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

## 7.1 Solved bugs
- When i wrote the project, i had most frequently indentation error as i forget to provide a tab
- The data input by users and app calcualted results were overwritten in the google sheet with the previously recorded data. this was solved by writing a code to save the evry new data entry and app calcualtion in a new row.
- When i wrote if statement, i forget to add colon at the end of if statement, which gave me unexpected indentation error. 
- I want to display the calcualted data in bullet points in the app but it took all the data from google sheet (including headings and data). This was solved by using pretty_array package.

## 7.2 Unsolved bugs
No bugs remaining

  The proejct was deployed to Heroku using the following steps:
- Sign up to Heroku and give a unique name to the app
- Inside the Heroku app page, go to the setting first and in the section config vars, add CREDS and paste entire creds.json file
- Add buildpack python and node.js (python on top and node.js on bottom)
- Go to the diploy section and select github and click connect to github
- Search git hub repository name related to the project to be depoloyed and click connect 
- Deploy to the branch (either mannual or automatic)

# 9. How does the app works?
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

## 9.1 Google data access and validation
The app has a credential to access google data sheet . The app validates the data input in the google sheet. If the data entry in google sheet is not correct the app gives a message"Google sheet data is not valid. Please check the data entry" (see figure below where data input is not valid in google sheet (highlighted)). Moreover the app users do not have to do anything to the google sheet.

![google-sheet-validation](images/google-sheet-validation.jpg)

## 9.2 Start of the APP
When the users run the coagulant dose calcualtor Heroku  app,
- It first display the what the app is about.
-  Ask user to enter flow rate in m3/s and do the validation of the data. 
- After validation of first input data, the user is asked to provide second input data i.e., storage time. The app does the validation of this second input as well.

![user-input](images/user-input.jpg)

## 9.3 Validation of user input
App validate the user's input data both flow rate and storage time (is data integer, float, and greater than 0). If data is not correct it ask users multiple time to provide correct input.

![user_validation](images/user-validation.jpg)

## 9.4 App calcualtion

If user's input data is validate, the program runs and calcualte the following:
- Optimum coagulant dose for all conditions.
- Total coagulant dose (for differnt type of coagulant used i.e. FeCl3) is calcualted based on the optimum coagulant dose and users input data of flow rate and storage time. This is calculated for all four types of conditions like pHRAW, pHRAW2, pHRAW3 and pHRAW4.

![app_calculation](images/calculation.jpg)

## 9.5 Google data sheet update 
All the new calcualtion and user's input data are updated in the google sheet 
- no overwritten with previous data entry is allowed, 
- data should be entered in new row
- in each simualtion four rows will be added for four differnt types of experimental conditions (pHRAW, pHRAW2, pHRAW3 and pHRAW4)
- Experimental condition is also recored in the last column to understand which data belong to what experiemntal condtions

![google-update](images/google-update.jpg)

## 9.6 Re-start the program 
To run the programm again, user has to click again run the programme.
